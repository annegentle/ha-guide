          <title>Memcached</title>

        <para>Most of OpenStack services use an application to offer persistence and store ephemeral data (like tokens).
Memcached is one of them and can scale-out easily without any specific tricks required.</para>
        <para>To install and configure it, read the <link xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/NewStart">official documentation</link>.</para>
        <para>Memory caching is managed by oslo-incubator so the way to use multiple memcached servers is the same for all projects.</para>
        <para>Example with two hosts:</para>
        <programlisting>memcached_servers = controller1:11211,controller2:11211</programlisting>
        <para>By default, controller1 handles the caching service but if the host goes down, controller2 does the job.
For more information about memcached installation, see the OpenStack
Cloud Administrator Guide.</para>
