==== Highly available OpenStack Networking Server

OpenStack Networking is the network connectivity service in OpenStack.
Making the OpenStack Networking Server service highly available in active / passive mode involves

* configuring OpenStack Networking to listen on the VIP address,
* managing OpenStack Networking API Server daemon with the Pacemaker cluster manager,
* configuring OpenStack services to use this IP address.

NOTE: Here is the http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/install-guide/install/apt/content/ch_installing-openstack-networking.html[documentation] for installing OpenStack Networking service.


===== Adding OpenStack Networking Server resource to Pacemaker

First of all, you need to download the resource agent to your system :
----
cd /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/openstack
wget https://raw.github.com/madkiss/openstack-resource-agents/master/ocf/neutron-server
chmod a+rx *
----

You may now proceed with adding the Pacemaker configuration for
OpenStack Networking Server resource. Connect to the Pacemaker cluster with +crm
configure+, and add the following cluster resources:
----
include::includes/pacemaker-neutron_server.crm[]
----

This configuration creates +p_neutron-server+, a resource for manage OpenStack Networking Server service

+crm configure+ supports batch input, so you may copy and paste the
above into your live pacemaker configuration, and then make changes as
required. For example, you may enter +edit p_neutron-server+ from the
+crm configure+ menu and edit the resource to match your preferred
virtual IP address.

Once completed, commit your configuration changes by entering +commit+
from the +crm configure+ menu. Pacemaker will then start the OpenStack Networking API
service, and its dependent resources, on one of your nodes.

===== Configuring OpenStack Networking Server

Edit +/etc/neutron/neutron.conf+ :
----
# We bind the service to the VIP :
bind_host = 192.168.42.103

# We bind OpenStack Networking Server to the VIP :
bind_host = 192.168.42.103

# We send notifications to Highly available RabbitMQ :
notifier_strategy = rabbit
rabbit_host = 192.168.42.102

[database]
# We have to use MySQL connection to store datas :
connection = mysql://neutron:password@192.168.42.101/neutron
----


===== Configuring OpenStack Services to use Highly available OpenStack Networking Server

Your OpenStack services must now point their OpenStack Networking Server configuration to
the highly available, virtual cluster IP address -- rather than an
OpenStack Networking server's physical IP address as you normally would.

For example, you should configure OpenStack Compute for using Highly Available OpenStack Networking Server in editing +nova.conf+ file :
----
neutron_url = http://192.168.42.103:9696
----

You need to create the OpenStack Networking Server Endpoint with this IP.

NOTE : If you are using both private and public IP addresses, you should create two Virtual IP addresses and define your endpoint like this:
----
keystone endpoint-create --region $KEYSTONE_REGION --service-id $service-id --publicurl 'http://PUBLIC_VIP:9696/' --adminurl 'http://192.168.42.103:9696/' --internalurl 'http://192.168.42.103:9696/'
