==== Highly available Cinder API

Cinder is the block storage service in OpenStack.
Making the Cinder API service highly available in active / passive mode involves

* configuring Cinder to listen on the VIP address,
* managing Cinder API daemon with the Pacemaker cluster manager,
* configuring OpenStack services to use this IP address.

NOTE: Here is the http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/install-guide/install/apt/content/cinder-install.html[documentation] for installing Cinder service.


===== Adding Cinder API resource to Pacemaker

First of all, you need to download the resource agent to your system :
  
----
cd /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/openstack
wget https://raw.github.com/madkiss/openstack-resource-agents/master/ocf/cinder-api
chmod a+rx *
----

You may now proceed with adding the Pacemaker configuration for
Cinder API resource. Connect to the Pacemaker cluster with +crm
configure+, and add the following cluster resources:

----
include::includes/pacemaker-cinder_api.crm[]
----

This configuration creates

* +p_cinder-api+, a resource for manage Cinder API service

+crm configure+ supports batch input, so you may copy and paste the
above into your live pacemaker configuration, and then make changes as
required. For example, you may enter +edit p_ip_cinder-api+ from the
+crm configure+ menu and edit the resource to match your preferred
virtual IP address.

Once completed, commit your configuration changes by entering +commit+
from the +crm configure+ menu. Pacemaker will then start the Cinder API
service, and its dependent resources, on one of your nodes.

===== Configuring Cinder API service

Edit +/etc/cinder/cinder.conf+ :
----
# We have to use MySQL connection to store datas :
sql_connection=mysql://cinder:password@192.168.42.101/cinder

# We bind Cinder API to the VIP :
osapi_volume_listen = 192.168.42.103

# We send notifications to High Available RabbitMQ :
notifier_strategy = rabbit
rabbit_host = 192.168.42.102
----


===== Configuring OpenStack Services to use High Available Cinder API

Your OpenStack services must now point their Cinder API configuration to
the highly available, virtual cluster IP address -- rather than a
Cinder API server's physical IP address as you normally would.

You need to create the Cinder API Endpoint with this IP.

NOTE : If you are using both private and public IP, you should create two Virtual IP and define your endpoint like this :
----
keystone endpoint-create --region $KEYSTONE_REGION --service-id $service-id --publicurl 'http://PUBLIC_VIP:8776/v1/%(tenant_id)s' --adminurl 'http://192.168.42.103:8776/v1/%(tenant_id)s' --internalurl 'http://192.168.42.103:8776/v1/%(tenant_id)s'
