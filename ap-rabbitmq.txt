==== Highly available RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is the default AMQP server used by many OpenStack
services. Making the RabbitMQ service highly available involves:

* configuring a DRBD device for use by RabbitMQ,
* configuring RabbitMQ to use a data directory residing on that DRBD
  device,
* selecting and assigning a virtual IP address (VIP) that can freely
  float between cluster nodes,
* configuring RabbitMQ to listen on that IP address,
* managing all resources, including the RabbitMQ daemon itself, with
  the Pacemaker cluster manager.

NOTE: There is an alternative method of configuring RabbitMQ for high
availability. That approach, known as
http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html[active-active mirrored queues],
happens to be the one preferred by the RabbitMQ developers -- however
it has shown less than ideal consistency and reliability in OpenStack
clusters. Thus, at the time of writing, the Pacemaker/DRBD based
approach remains the recommended one for OpenStack environments,
although this may change in the near future as RabbitMQ active-active
mirrored queues mature.

===== Configure DRBD

The Pacemaker based RabbitMQ server requires a DRBD resource from
which it mounts the +/var/lib/rabbitmq+ directory. In this example,
the DRBD resource is simply named +rabbitmq+:

.+rabbitmq+ DRBD resource configuration (+/etc/drbd.d/rabbitmq.res+)
----
include::includes/rabbitmq.res[]
----

This resource uses an underlying local disk (in DRBD terminology, a
_backing device_) named +/dev/data/rabbitmq+ on both cluster nodes,
+node1+ and +node2+. Normally, this would be an LVM Logical Volume
specifically set aside for this purpose. The DRBD +meta-disk+ is
+internal+, meaning DRBD-specific metadata is being stored at the end
of the +disk+ device itself. The device is configured to communicate
between IPv4 addresses 10.0.42.100 and 10.0.42.254, using TCP port
7701. Once enabled, it will map to a local DRBD block device with the
device minor number 1, that is, +/dev/drbd1+.

Enabling a DRBD resource is explained in detail in
http://www.drbd.org/users-guide-8.3/s-first-time-up.html[the DRBD
User's Guide]. In brief, the proper sequence of commands is this:

----
drbdadm create-md rabbitmq <1>
drbdadm up rabbitmq <2>
drbdadm -- --force primary rabbitmq <3>
----

<1> Initializes DRBD metadata and writes the initial set of metadata
to +/dev/data/rabbitmq+. Must be completed on both nodes.

<2> Creates the +/dev/drbd1+ device node, _attaches_ the DRBD device
to its backing store, and _connects_ the DRBD node to its peer. Must
be completed on both nodes.

<3> Kicks off the initial device synchronization, and puts the device
into the +primary+ (readable and writable) role. See
http://www.drbd.org/users-guide-8.3/ch-admin.html#s-roles[Resource
roles] (from the DRBD User's Guide) for a more detailed description of
the primary and secondary roles in DRBD. Must be completed _on one
node only,_ namely the one where you are about to continue with
creating your filesystem.

===== Create a file system

Once the DRBD resource is running and in the primary role (and
potentially still in the process of running the initial device
synchronization), you may proceed with creating the filesystem for
RabbitMQ data. XFS is generally the recommended filesystem:

----
mkfs -t xfs /dev/drbd1
----

You may also use the alternate device path for the DRBD device, which
may be easier to remember as it includes the self-explanatory resource
name:

----
mkfs -t xfs /dev/drbd/by-res/rabbitmq
----

Once completed, you may safely return the device to the secondary
role. Any ongoing device synchronization will continue in the
background:

----
drbdadm secondary rabbitmq
----

===== Prepare RabbitMQ for Pacemaker high availability

In order for Pacemaker monitoring to function properly, you must
ensure that RabbitMQ's +.erlang.cookie+ files are identical on all
nodes, regardless of whether DRBD is mounted there or not. The
simplest way of doing so is to take an existing +.erlang.cookie+ from
one of your nodes, copying it to the RabbitMQ data directory on the
other node, and also copying it to the DRBD-backed filesystem.

----
node1:# scp -a /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie node2:/var/lib/rabbitmq/
node1:# mount /dev/drbd/by-res/rabbitmq /mnt
node1:# cp -a /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie /mnt
node1:# umount /mnt
----

===== Add RabbitMQ resources to Pacemaker

You may now proceed with adding the Pacemaker configuration for
RabbitMQ resources. Connect to the Pacemaker cluster with +crm
configure+, and add the following cluster resources:

----
include::includes/pacemaker-rabbitmq.crm[]
----

This configuration creates

* +p_ip_rabbitmp+, a virtual IP address for use by RabbitMQ
  (192.168.42.100),
* +p_fs_rabbitmq+, a Pacemaker managed filesystem mounted to
  +/var/lib/rabbitmq+ on whatever node currently runs the RabbitMQ
  service,
* +ms_drbd_rabbitmq+, the _master/slave set_ managing the +rabbitmq+
  DRBD resource,
* a service +group+ and +order+ and +colocation+ constraints to ensure
  resources are started on the correct nodes, and in the correct sequence.

+crm configure+ supports batch input, so you may copy and paste the
above into your live pacemaker configuration, and then make changes as
required. For example, you may enter +edit p_ip_rabbitmq+ from the
+crm configure+ menu and edit the resource to match your preferred
virtual IP address.

Once completed, commit your configuration changes by entering +commit+
from the +crm configure+ menu. Pacemaker will then start the RabbitMQ
service, and its dependent resources, on one of your nodes.

===== Configure OpenStack services for highly available RabbitMQ

Your OpenStack services must now point their RabbitMQ configuration to
the highly available, virtual cluster IP address -- rather than a
RabbitMQ server's physical IP address as you normally would.

For OpenStack Image, for example, if your RabbitMQ service IP address is
192.168.42.100 as in the configuration explained here, you would use
the following line in your OpenStack Image API configuration file
(+glance-api.conf+):

----
rabbit_host = 192.168.42.100
----

No other changes are necessary to your OpenStack configuration. If the
node currently hosting your RabbitMQ experiences a problem
necessitating service failover, your OpenStack services may experience
a brief RabbitMQ interruption, as they would in the event of a network
hiccup, and then continue to run normally.
