          <title>Run neutron L3 agent</title>

        <para>The neutron L3 agent is scalable, due to the scheduler
that allows distribution of virtual routers across multiple nodes.
There is no native feature to make these routers highly available.
At this time, the active/passive solution exists to run the Neutron L3
agent in failover mode with Pacemaker. See the active/passive
section of this guide.</para>
