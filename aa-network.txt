=== OpenStack network nodes

OpenStack network nodes contain:

* neutron DHCP agent
* neutron L2 agent
* Neutron L3 agent
* neutron metadata agent
* neutron lbaas agent

NOTE: The neutron L2 agent does not need to be highly available. It has to be
installed on each Data Forwarding Node and controls the virtual networking
drivers as Open vSwitch or Linux Bridge. One L2 agent runs per node
and controls its virtual interfaces. That's why it cannot be distributed and
highly available.


==== Run neutron DHCP agent

OpenStack Networking service has a scheduler that
lets you run multiple agents across nodes. Also, the DHCP agent can be natively
highly available. For details, see http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/config-reference/content/app_demo_multi_dhcp_agents.html[OpenStack Configuration Reference].

==== Run neutron L3 agent

The neutron L3 agent is scalable thanks to the scheduler
that allows distribution of virtual routers across multiple nodes.
But there is no native feature to make these routers highly available.
At this time, the Active / Passive solution exists to run the Neutron L3
agent in failover mode with Pacemaker. See the Active / Passive
section of this guide.

==== Run neutron metadata agent

There is no native feature to make this service highly available.
At this time, the Active / Passive solution exists to run the neutron
metadata agent in failover mode with Pacemaker. See the Active /
Passive section of this guide.
